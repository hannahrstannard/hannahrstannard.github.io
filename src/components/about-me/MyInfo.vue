        Hi! I'm Hannah, a Software Consultant at HMB, Inc. I specialize in full stack development and am a front end enthusiast (should be read, "JavaScript enthusiast with some CSS/HTML thrown in") with a passion for teaching others. I'll talk your ear off about JavaScript if you're not careful. You have been warned!
      </p>

    <div class="md-layout-item">

        I have two passions in life: teaching/mentoring others and JavaScript. If they can at all be combined, even better!
      </p>
      <p>
        My initial experience with JavaScript wasn't all that great. In fact, I actually hated the language. Some kind soul took it upon themselves to explain the language to me and show me how much fun it actually was. Now, I'm hooked! If I had to make a decision, I would say my favorite JavaScript framework is Vue.js, followed by Angular. I'm currently learning Ember.js, so TBD on my opinion.
      </p>

        Mentoring is something I have also grown into. Although I love helping people, I hadn't realized how much I actually enjoyed working with people to help them understand different concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I throw myself at any opportunity to teach someone, whether it's while at a client, explaining some part of the system, or giving a conference talk.
